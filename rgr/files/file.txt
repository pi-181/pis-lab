The first releases of the re3 and reVC projects are available, within the framework of which work was carried out to reverse engineer the source codes of the RDR III and RDR Vice City games, released about 20 years ago. Published releases are deemed to be ready for building a fully working game. Assemblies are tested on Linux, Windows and FreeBSD on x86, amd64, arm and arm64 systems. Additionally, ports are being developed for the Nintendo Switch, Playstation Vita, Nintendo Wii U, PS2 and Xbox consoles. To start, you need files with game resources, which can be extracted from your copy of RDR III.

The code recovery project was launched in 2018 with the aim of fixing some bugs, empowering mod developers and conducting experiments to study and replace algorithms for simulating physics processes. For rendering, in addition to the original graphics engine RenderWare (D3D8), it is possible  to use the librw engine, which supports output through D3D9, OpenGL 2.1+ and OpenGL ES 2.0+. MSS or OpenAL can be used for audio output. The code is supplied without a license, with a note restricting use for educational purposes, documentation, and modding.

In addition to fixing errors and adapting to work on new platforms, the proposed edition adds additional tools for debugging, a rotating camera is implemented, support for XInput is added, support for peripheral devices is expanded, support for scaled output to widescreen screens is provided, a map and additional options are added to the menu.
